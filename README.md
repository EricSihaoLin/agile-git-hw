The article I read was [Four software development lessons from the Super Bowl](https://sdtimes.com/softwaredev/four-software-development-lessonsfrom-the-super-bowl/).

I found it interesting that the author relates how the Patriots were able to win in the recent Super Bowl through ideologies that companies can follow so that their software development process can be successful. The article discusses four lessons:
* having the right company culture
* starting strong in projects
* focusing on the basics and not losing sight in the development process
* protecting the company’s brand through product excellence. 

Although I believe that the fourth lesson is a given when working for a company, I think it’s important to think about starting strong in a project; more specifically, developers should test for bugs and communicate with stakeholders and the rest of the team early on to continue producing quality software and avoid disaster at the end of the project’s deadline. In addition, developers should always hold onto the development process fundamentals and not be distracted by new technologies that are coming out.
